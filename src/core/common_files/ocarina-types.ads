package Ocarina.Types is
--  pragma Preelaborate (Ocarina.Types);

--  This package contains host independent type definitions which are used
--  in more than one unit in the compiler. They are gathered here for easy
--  reference, though in some cases the full description is found in the
--  relevant module which implements the definition. The main reason that
--  they are not in their "natural" specs is that this would cause a lot of
--  inter-spec dependencies, and in particular some awkward circular
--  dependencies would have to be dealt with.

   -------------------------------
   -- General Use Integer Types --
   -------------------------------

   type Int is range -2 ** 31 .. +2 ** 31 - 1;
   --  Signed 32-bit integer

   type Dint is range -2 ** 63 .. +2 ** 63 - 1;
   --  Double length (64-bit) integer

   subtype Nat is Int range 0 .. Int'Last;
   --  Non-negative Int values

   subtype Dnat is Dint range 0 .. Dint'Last;

   subtype Pos is Int range 1 .. Int'Last;
   --  Positive Int values

   type Word is mod 2 ** 32;
   --  Unsigned 32-bit integer

   type Byte is mod 2 ** 8;
   for Byte'Size use 8;
   --  8-bit unsigned integer

   type size_t is mod 2 ** Standard'Address_Size;
   --  Memory size value, for use in calls to C routines

   --------------------------------------
   -- 8-Bit Character and String Types --
   --------------------------------------

   --  We use Standard.Character and Standard.String freely, since we are
   --  compiling ourselves, and we properly implement the required 8-bit
   --  character code as required in Ada 95. This section defines a few
   --  general use constants and subtypes.

   EOF : constant Character := ASCII.SUB;
   --  The character SUB (16#1A#) is used in DOS and other systems derived
   --  from DOS (OS/2, NT etc) to signal the end of a text file. Internally
   --  all source files are ended by an EOF character, even on Unix systems.
   --  An EOF character acts as the end of file only as the last character
   --  of a source buffer, in any other position, it is treated as a blank
   --  if it appears between tokens, and as an illegal character otherwise.
   --  This makes life easier dealing with files that originated from DOS,
   --  including concatenated files with interspersed EOF characters.

   subtype Graphic_Character is Character range ' ' .. '~';
   --  Graphic characters, as defined in ARM

   subtype Line_Terminator is Character range ASCII.LF .. ASCII.CR;
   --  Line terminator characters (LF, VT, FF, CR)

   subtype Upper_Half_Character is
     Character range Character'Val (16#80#) .. Character'Val (16#FF#);
   --  Characters with the upper bit set

   type Character_Ptr is access all Character;
   type String_Ptr    is access all String;
   --  Standard character and string pointers

   procedure Free is new Unchecked_Deallocation (String, String_Ptr);
   --  Procedure for freeing dynamically allocated String values

   procedure Change_If_Empty (Str_Ptr : in out String_Ptr; Value : String);
   pragma Inline (Change_If_Empty);
   --  If Str_Ptr is null or points to the empty string, reallocate
   --  it with the given Value.

   -----------------------------------------
   -- Types Used for Text Buffer Handling --
   -----------------------------------------

   --  We can't use type String for text buffers, since we must use the
   --  standard 32-bit integer as an index value, since we count on all
   --  index values being the same size.

   type Text_Ptr is new Int;
   --  Type used for subscripts in text buffer

   type Text_Buffer is array (Text_Ptr range <>) of Character;
   --  Text buffer used to hold source file or library information file

   --  Text buffers for input files are allocated dynamically and this type
   --  is used to reference these text buffers.

   --  reference pragma.

   --  Line number type, used for storing physical line numbers (i.e.

   --  the presence of source reference pragmas.
