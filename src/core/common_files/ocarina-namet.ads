package Ocarina.Namet is

--  This package contains routines for handling the names table. The table
--  is used to store character strings for identifiers and operator symbols,
--  as well as other string values such as unit names and file names.

--  The names are hashed so that a given name appears only once in the table,
--  except that names entered with Name_Enter as opposed to Name_Find are
--  omitted from the hash table.

--  The first 26 entries in the names table (with Name_Id values in the range
--  First_Name_Id .. First_Name_Id + 25) represent names which are the one
--  character lower case letters in the range a-z, and these names are created
--  and initialized by the Initialize procedure.

--  Two values, one of type Int and one of type Byte, are stored with each
--  names table entry and subprograms are provided for setting and retrieving
--  these associated values. The usage of these values is up to the client.

   Name_Buffer : String (1 .. 16 * 1024);
   --  This buffer is used to set the name to be stored in the table for the
   --  Name_Find call, and to retrieve the name for the Get_Name_String call.
   --  The plus 1 in the length allows for cases of adding ASCII.NUL. The
   --  16K here is intended to be an infinite value that ensures that we
   --  never overflow the buffer (names this long are too absurd to worry!)

   Name_Len : Natural;
   --  Length of name stored in Name_Buffer. Used as an input parameter for
   --  Name_Find, and as an output value by Get_Name_String, or Write_Name.

   -----------------
   -- Subprograms --
   -----------------

   procedure Get_Name_String (Id : Name_Id);
   --  Get_Name_String is used to retrieve the string associated with an entry
   --  in the names table. The resulting string is stored in Name_Buffer
   --  and Name_Len is set. It is an error to call Get_Name_String with one
   --  of the special name Id values (No_Name or Error_Name).

   function Get_Name_String (Id : Name_Id) return String;
   --  This functional form returns the result as a string without affecting
   --  the contents of either Name_Buffer or Name_Len.

   procedure Get_Name_String_And_Append (Id : Name_Id);
   --  Like Get_Name_String but the resulting characters are appended to
   --  the current contents of the entry stored in Name_Buffer, and Name_Len
   --  is incremented to include the added characters.

   function Get_Name_Table_Byte (Id : Name_Id) return Byte;
   pragma Inline (Get_Name_Table_Byte);
   --  Fetches the Byte value associated with the given name

   function Get_Name_Table_Info (Id : Name_Id) return Int;
   pragma Inline (Get_Name_Table_Info);
   --  Fetches the Int value associated with the given name

   function Get_String_Name (The_String : String) return Name_Id;
   --  Enters 'The_String' in the name table and returns the
   --  corresponding name id.

   procedure Initialize;
   --  Initializes the names table, including initializing the first 26
   --  entries in the table (for the 1-character lower case names a-z)
   --  Note that Initialize must not be called if Tree_Read is used.

   function Name_Find return Name_Id;
   --  Name_Find is called with a string stored in Name_Buffer whose length
   --  is in Name_Len (i.e. the characters of the name are in subscript
   --  positions 1 to Name_Len in Name_Buffer). It searches the names
   --  table to see if the string has already been stored. If so the Id of
   --  the existing entry is returned. Otherwise a new entry is created with
   --  its Name_Table_Info field set to zero. The contents of Name_Buffer
   --  and Name_Len are not modified by this call.

   function Name_Enter return Name_Id;
   --  Name_Enter has the same calling interface as Name_Find. The difference
   --  is that it does not search the table for an existing match, and also
   --  subsequent Name_Find calls using the same name will not locate the
   --  entry created by this call. Thus multiple calls to Name_Enter with the
   --  same name will create multiple entries in the name table with different
   --  Name_Id values. This is useful in the case of created names, which are
   --  never expected to be looked up. Note: Name_Enter should never be used
   --  for one character names, since these are efficiently located without
   --  hashing by Name_Find in any case.

   procedure Add_Char_To_Name_Buffer (C : Character);
   pragma Inline (Add_Char_To_Name_Buffer);

   --  required.

   procedure Add_Str_To_Name_Buffer (S : String);
   --  Add characters of string S to the end of the string currently stored
   --  in the Name_Buffer, incrementing Name_Len by the length of the string.

   procedure Set_Str_To_Name_Buffer (S : String);
   pragma Inline (Set_Str_To_Name_Buffer);

   pragma Inline (Set_Name_Table_Byte);
   --  Sets the Byte value associated with the given name

   procedure Write_Name (Id : Name_Id);
   --  Write_Name writes the characters of the specified name using the
   --  standard output procedures in package Output. No end of line is
   --  written, just the characters of the name. On return Name_Buffer and
   --  Name_Len are set as for a call to Get_Name_String. The name is written
   --  in encoded form (i.e. including Uhh, Whhh, Qx, _op as they appear in
   --  the name table). If Id is Error_Name, or No_Name, no text is output.

   procedure wn (Id : Name_Id);
--   pragma Export (Ada, wn);
   --  Like Write_Name, but includes new line at end. Intended for use
   --  from the debugger only.

   function Is_Bad_Spelling_Of (Found, Expect : Name_Id) return Boolean;
   --  Return true if Found is a possible misspelling of Expect

   procedure Is_Bad_Spelling (Found : Name_Id);
   --  Scan all entries in name table, return the first possible
   --  misspelling of Found.

   --  This table stores the actual string names. Although logically there
   --  is no need for a terminating character (since the length is stored
   --  in the name entry table), we still store a NUL character at the end
   --  of every name (for convenience in interfacing to the C world).

      --  one's origin, so this avoids unnecessary adds and subtracts of 1.

      Name_Len : Short;
