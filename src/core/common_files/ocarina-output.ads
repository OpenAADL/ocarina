   -- Subprograms --
   -----------------

   procedure Set_Output (New_Output : GNAT.OS_Lib.File_Descriptor);
   --  Sets subsequent output to appear on the given file

   procedure Set_Standard_Error;
   --  Sets subsequent output to appear on the standard error file
   --  (whatever that might mean for the host operating system, if
   --  anything).

   procedure Set_Standard_Output;
   --  Sets subsequent output to appear on the standard output file
   --  (whatever that might mean for the host operating system, if
   --  anything). Output to standard output is the default mode before
   --  any call to either of the Set procedures.

   function Current_Output return GNAT.OS_Lib.File_Descriptor;
   --  Return the current output

   procedure Write_Char (C : Character);
   --  Write one character to the standard output file. Note that the
   --  character should not be LF or CR (use Write_Eol for end of line)

   procedure Write_Eol (N : Natural := 1);
   --  Write an end of line (whatever is required by the system in use,
   --  e.g. CR/LF for DOS, or LF for Unix) to the standard output file.
   --  This routine also empties the line buffer, actually writing it
   --  to the file. Note that Write_Eol is the only routine that causes
   --  any actual output to be written.

   procedure Write_Int (Val : Int);
   --  Write an integer value with no leading blanks or zeroes. Negative
   --  values are preceded by a minus sign).

   procedure Write_Str (S : String);
   --  Write a string of characters to the standard output file. Note that
   --  end of line is handled separately using WRITE_EOL, so the string
   --  should not contain either of the characters LF or CR, but it may
   --  contain horizontal tab characters.

   procedure Write_Line (S : String);
   --  Equivalent to Write_Str (S) followed by Write_Eol;

   procedure Write_Quoted_Str (S : String);
   --  Same as above but with S quoted between two '"'

   function Column return Nat;
   pragma Inline (Column);
   --  Returns the number of the column about to be written (e.g. a value
   --  of 1 means the current line is empty).
