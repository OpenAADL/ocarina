package Native_UART

-- This package models a UART protocol layer for the PolyORB-HI/Ada
-- AADL runtime. It defines the subprograms and threads to be
-- integrated with the runtime low level interface.
--
-- To configure this interface, you should use the
-- Deployment::Configuration property with the following format:
--     "serial DEVICE BAUDS DATA_BITS PARITY STOP_BIT"
--
-- e.g.
--
--     uart : device GRUART::GRUART_Device
--            {Deployment::Configuration => "serial /dev/ttyS0 9600 8 N 1"
--

   -- on the 'Implement_As' feature that defines its full
   -- specification.

   -- THREADS --
   -------------

   -- This thread handles the execution logic of the protocol
   -- stack. It relies on the previous subprograms to receive
   -- messages.

   thread Driver_Native_UART_Protocol_thread_receiver

      -- This thread is dispatched when an event is detected on the
      -- real hardware. It then calls receive to handle the incoming
      -- event.

   -- SUBPROGRAMS --
   -----------------

   -- These subprograms model the high-level view of the SpaceWire
   -- protocol stack. They define an API used by the stack to send and
   -- receive data, and perform node's initialisation.

   subprogram Initialize

     -- Initialize the different internal resources for managing
     -- connections on a node. This subprogram has no formal visible
     -- parameters, but relies on well-known data structures and
     -- variables to configure the stack.

   properties
      Source_Name => "PolyORB_HI_Drivers_Native_UART.Initialize";
      Source_Language => (Ada);
   end Initialize;

   subprogram Receive

      -- Receive data and dispatch them to the receiving entity. This
      -- program and its sibling (send) share a common protocol, not
      -- defined in the AADL model.

   properties
      Source_Name => "PolyORB_HI_Drivers_Native_UART.Receive";
      Source_Language => (Ada);
   end Receive;

   -------------

   subprogram Send

      -- Send data to a remote node. This program and its sibling
      -- (receive) share a common protocol, not defined in the AADL
      -- model.

   properties
      Source_Name => "PolyORB_HI_Drivers_Native_UART.Send";
