--Fixed represents a fixed distribution and takes a single parameter OccurrenceRate or ProbabilityValue.
--Poisson aka. Exponential represents an exponential distribution and takes a single parameter OccurrenceRate or ProbabilityValue.
--Normal aka. Gauss represents a distribution with an explicitly specified MeanValue and StandardDeviation.
--Weibull represents a shaped distribution with a ShapeParameter and a ScaleParameter.
--Binominal represents represents a discrete distribution with a SuccessCount, a SampleCount, and a Probability parameter.

DistributionFunction : type enumeration (Fixed, Poisson, Exponential, Normal, Gauss, Weibull, Binominal);

DurationDistributionSpecification : type record (
Duration : Time_Range;

DurationDistribution : EMV2::DurationDistributionSpecification applies to ({emv2}**Repair Event, {emv2}**Recover Event,
    {emv2}**Error Behavior Transition);

-- A PropagationTimeDelay property indicates the delay in propagating and error as a distribution over a time interval.
-- For example, as a property associated with a connection it indicates the time delay of the error propagation.

PropagationTimeDelay: EMV2::DurationDistributionSpecification
    applies to (connection, {emv2}**propagation path);

StateKind : EMV2::StateKindEnum
  applies to ({emv2}**error behavior state);

StateKindEnum: type enumeration (Working, NonWorking);

-- Indicates whether an error type is detectable
DetectionMechanism : aadlstring
  applies to ({emv2}**error detection);


-- The FaultKind property allows the user to specify whether an error source,
-- i.e., the occurrence of a fault activation or a propagation is due to a design fault or an operational fault.
-- Design faults are faults that could be eliminated at design time, but if present result in an error.
-- Operational faults are faults that inherently occur during operation and should be detected and managed during operation.
FaultKind : EMV2::FaultKindEnum
  applies to ( {emv2}**error event, {emv2}**error propagation, {emv2}**error source, {emv2}**error type, {emv2}**type set);

FaultKindEnum: type enumeration (Design, Operational);


-- The Persistence property allows the user to specify whether an error is permanent, transient, or a singleton.
-- A permanent error typically requires a repair action to the component with the fault occurrence.
-- A transient error has a limited duration and typically requires a recovery action.
-- In a discrete event system a transient error may last over several discrete events, e.g., a corrupted message may be sent over multiple periods.
-- A singleton error occurs in the context of a single discrete event. For example, a divide by zero error may be specific to a computation on a particular input.
Persistence : EMV2::PersistenceEnum
  applies to ({emv2}**error type, {emv2}**type set, {emv2}**error behavior state,
    {emv2}**error behavior event, {emv2}**error propagation);

PersistenceEnum: type enumeration (Permanent, Transient, Singleton);

-- The severity property value indicates the severity of the hazard ranging from 1 (high) to 5 (low).
-- MIL-STD 882D refers to it as SeverityCategory with equivalent descriptive labels as SeverityLevel.
-- Qualify these labels (Catastrophic, Critical, Marginal, Negligible) with MILSTD882::

-- ARP 4761 calls this SeverityClassification with descriptive labels
-- (Catastrophic, Hazardous, Major, Minor, NoEffect) (qualify with ARP4761::).

-- The likelihood property value indicates the likelihood of the hazard ranging from A (high) to E (low).
-- MIL-STD 882D uses descriptive labels (Frequent, Probable, Occasional, Remote, Improbable) (See property set MILSTD882).
-- ARP 4761 uses descriptive labels (Frequent, Probable, Remote, ExtremelyRemote, ExtremelyImprobable) (See property set ARP4761).

Likelihood : inherit EMV2::LikelihoodLabels applies to ({emv2}**error type, {emv2}**type set, {emv2}**error behavior state,
