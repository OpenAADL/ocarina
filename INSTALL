To compile and install Ocarina, just type:

./configure [options]
make
make install

type ./configure --help to get the list of possible options.

If you modify source files, build Ocarina after a checkout or make
distclean, or the directory hierarchy of the source files, you should
re-generate autoconf and automake files (configure, Makefile.in...);
to do this, from the main directory, run:

./support/reconfig

For more details, please refer to Ocarina's documentation.
