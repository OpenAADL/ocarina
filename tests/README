Add a test
----------

1. Create a directory

2. Put your files into this directory

3. You must provide a list of primitives
	Cmd        : the command to execute
	Output     : the trace file if there is something after the execution of 
	             your command
	Success    : yes or no , depends if the command must run successfully
	DiffSource : file or directory. If you use an output (with Output
	             directive) and compare the output of the command with it,
					 you traditionally use the output of the command (stdout/stderr).
					 If you want to use another source of diff, you can provide
					 the file or the directory with DiffSource

	You can provide several commands to execute. Consequently,
	you must provide the number after the directive. For example :
	Cmd0: ocarina test.aadl
	Success0: yes
	Cmd1: gnatmake test.adb
	Success1: no
	Output1: test.adb.trace

	The trace must contain the content of stdout and stderr. Typically,
	we have it using command args > tracefile 2>&1

4. Add the directory to TestList.mk
