We considered the problem of requirements enforcement in 
programs generated from architectural models. We proposed a simple
solution to the problem without need for extra meta-model knowledge.

Standard conformance can be verified by pre-defined REAL theorems,
as we did for the Ravenscar Profile. REAL can also be used by
modelers in order to implement requirements defined at a
higher-level. REAL can be used as a low-level requirements
definition language.

In both cases, code-level conformance is ensured by the REAL
runtime.  Hence, REAL can help to build secure architectural models
without losing the code conformance offered by Ocarina generator.

Our future work will consist of develop a process in which REAL
would be used for optimization at model-level. A first possibility
would be to use it in order to test performance and
correctness. Another interesting - an not exclusive - possibility is
to use it to select a subset of REAL instances candidates to
optimization.

With efficients code generators, performing optimization at model
level would allow to definitively prevent the users to work at
code-level, thus eliminating an error-prone and time-consuming part of
the embedded software development process.
